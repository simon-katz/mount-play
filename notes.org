* Notes on mount
** Docs talk a lot about namespaces
*** as if there can be one `defstate` per namespace
*** maybe that was the case at one time
*** the `defstate` macro does something with `*ns*`, which is weird
*** See [[*Interesting%20comment%20in%20`mount.tools.graph`][Interesting comment in `mount.tools.graph`]]
** :deps doesn't work
*** See [[*Interesting%20comment%20in%20`mount.tools.graph`][Interesting comment in `mount.tools.graph`]]
** Interesting comment in `mount.tools.graph`
*** that deps should be state-based, not ns-based
